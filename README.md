Magento Developer Helper will relieve the pain developers experience working with already overridden Magento classes (models, routers, blocks, helpers). There is no more need to rack brains over what has been rewritten and open every module manually for that purpose. The extension provides the list of changes, made by other developers, and indicates where rewritings are located.

Key features:

* Build-in indicator of overridden classes in Magento
* Detection of overridden models, routers, blocks and helpers
* List of defined in config.xml observers
